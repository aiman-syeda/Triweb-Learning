# TypeScript

A JavaScript project can be easily converted into a TypeScript project..Here I have created a project in js first and then converted it into TypeScript by making some minor changes and adding some more dependencies  to the project.But you will see them all in .ts.For detailed steps you may follow [Notes.txt](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/TypeScript/Notes.txt).


- üìÅ [**Source_Folder:**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/tree/main/TypeScript/src)
  
     1. [app.ts:](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/TypeScript/src/app.ts)This is the entry point of a project.

     2. [controllers:](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/tree/main/TypeScript/src/controller)The functionality of a project lies in this folder.And controllers also connects with models.

     3. [routers:](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/tree/main/TypeScript/src/routers)Routers creates routes and connects with the server.

     4. [models:](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/tree/main/TypeScript/src/models)Database models are created here.

- [**tsconfig.json:**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/TypeScript/tsconfig.json) This is a autogenerated file upon tsc initialization and we make changes in this file according to our requirements.

- [**yarn.lock:**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/TypeScript/yarn.lock)It's a packages manager file.

- [**package.json:**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/TypeScript/package.json)This file contains the details of dependencies and their exact versions.
