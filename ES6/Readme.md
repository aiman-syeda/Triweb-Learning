# ES6

Here you will find the concepts that were not present in JavaScript but later they were through ES6,these are really helpful don't hesitate to learn them.

- [**Object_Matching**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/array_destructuring.js):See shorthand notation object matching,deep matching,Fail soft destructuring.

- [**Arrays**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/array_like_str.js):Learn to convert strings to arrays and array methods such as .find() and .findIndex().

- [**Arrow_Function**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/arrow_function.js):It's just like the function but the syntax of arrow function is really simple.

- [**Computed_Property**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/computed_property.js):Keys can also be variables.

- [**Constants**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/constant.js):Variables that are immutable.

- [**Default_&_Rest_Parameters**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/default_parameter_and_rest_parameter.js):Functions that has default and rest parameters. 

- [**For_of_Loop**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/for_of_loop.js):The for...of statement executes a loop that operates on a sequence of values sourced from an iterable object. 
Iterable objects include instances of built-ins such as Array, String, TypedArray, Map, Set,NodeList (and other DOM collections), as well as the arguments object, generators produced by generator functions, and user-defined iterables

- [**.includes()**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/includes_method.js):The string method to see if a string is a substring if another.

- [**Math**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/math.js):Math.trunc(),Math.sign,Math cuberoot,log.

- [**Number_Method**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/number_method.js):Some number methods to find MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, MIN_SAFE_INTEGER,isFinite(),isNaN() etc.

- [**Object_As_Key**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/object_as_key.js):An example to use object as keys.

- [**Promise**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/promise.js):The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

- [**Scope**](https://github.com/aiman-syeda/Triweb-Learning/blob/main/ES6/scope.js):The scope of a variable of type var,let and const is clearly demonstrated.
